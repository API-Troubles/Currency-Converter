# Currency Converter!

Ever wanted to convert currency? Didn't wanna google it for some odd reason? Feel like suffering with me?

Well I've got the medical* solution for you!

*I am not a doctor, just a horrible programmer

## How to use:
Simple! Run the code in whatever place you want and-- oh wait, you need an API key. Don't worry, I spent 0$ on this and so will you! 
Simply go to [the currency api website](https://currencyapi.com/) to get yourself a key! Everytime you run the code is 2 API calls, and they give 500 for free.
So you can run this script ~250 times. Or around 8 times a day, every day, for a whole month!

Insert the API key on line 9 on main.py and your off to the races! Enjoy!
